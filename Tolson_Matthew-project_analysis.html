The goal of the redesign is to bring the site more of a functional layout.  The site currently does not have a professional look or consistency.

			<h2>Competitors</h2>
			<p>I researched the three closest choruses to the DGMC. After reviewing each of the sites they all have a better look to the site, and clear Call to Actions. The best one in my opinion is the Cincinnati Men’s Chorus website, which is the closest to the DGMC and the biggest competitor. </p>

				<h3>Cincinnati Men’s Chorus</h3>
				<a href="http://www.cincinnatimenschorus.org/">http://www.cincinnatimenschorus.org/</a>
				<p>Looking through the CMC’s site they have clear Call to Actions, great layout, and a professional look to the site. There is lots of information about the organization, concerts that are coming up. The size of the organization is double the DGMC’s size.  The population of Cincinnati is about double the size of that of Dayton.</p>

				<h3>Columbus Gay Men’s Chorus</h3>
				<a href="http://www.cgmc.com/">http://www.cgmc.com/</a>
